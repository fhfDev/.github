# Hello and welcome to 404 Development 🙌🏻 [ ![Views](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/fhfDev) ]

We are pleased you are browsing our profile, and we hope you will find our projects interesting. 

We are a group of students developing websites, web applications, and computer games. You can check our public projects in the [Repositories section](https://github.com/orgs/fhfDev/repositories) here on GitHub. We don't cease with the two published projects. 

We are currently working on a computer game that will publish by the end of the year. We can't release more details yet but be sure to stay tuned for more information - everything will be announced here on our profile in advance! 👀

If you like our projects, every follow/star will surely make us happy and motivate us in further development. 

Thank you! 😊
